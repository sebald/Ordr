		<h3>Why can't I log in? It always says: &quot;You entered the wrong unsername and/or password.&quot;</h3>
		<p>First of all, just because <em>ordr</em> tells you that you have entered a wrong username or password doesn't mean that's necesseraily true. Sound dumb? But actually this is a security measure, which helps against brood force attacks because the adversary doesn't know if the username he guessed was correct or not.</p>
		<p>Usually there are two common reasons why you can't log in. There are:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>Your account hasn't been activated by an admin yet.</em> &ndash; In this case ask a admin if he already has activated your account.</li>
			<li><em>You mistyped your password or username.</em> &ndash; Just try it another time and make sure caps log isn't activated.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Why can't I choose my own username?</h3>
		<p>We want to enforce a specific guideline for the username. Namely <em>first name</em> followed immediately by the <em>last name</em>. This way everyone can easily identify the person, who placed an order. So please enter your real name into the registration form. Otherwise your account may not been activated because no one knows who you are.</p>

		<h3>Why can I only edit my email after I registered?</h3>
		<p>Your username depends on your first and last name. Changing the username is not allowed, therefore you are also not allowed to change your first and last name afterwards. Even admins can not change your first/last name and your username.</p>
